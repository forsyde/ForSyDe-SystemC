* Noteworthy changes in release 0.3.0 (2013-05-05)

** General Improvements

  Re-designed the library based on a common abstract semantics.
  
  Re-implemented the introspection facility. Now the models dump their
  structure as a well-defined XML format. There is also support for
  basic type-introspection.
  
  Added support for the new MoCs untimed (UT) and discrete-time (DT),
  and re-implemented the discrete-event (DE) MoC based on the common
  abstract semantics.
  
  Added new domain interfaces DE2CT, CT2DE, SY2DE, DE2SY, SDF2SY, SY2SDF.
  
  Several new examples for different MoCs.
  
  Added support for basic parallel and distributed simulation using MPI.
  
  Added support for data-parallel operations by adding new process
  constructors to the SY MoC.
