ForSyDe-SystemC comes as a header-only library. Thus, it is sufficient to
include the src folder in the search path during compilation or copy it to a
global include path of the system. Don't forget to have the SystemC library
also in your include path and link against it.

ForSyDe-SystemC relies on several C++11 features. You will need an updated
compiler to work with this library.
