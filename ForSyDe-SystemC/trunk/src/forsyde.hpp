/*! \mainpage ForSyDe-SystemC API Documentation
 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This documentation is supplied as the API-level guideline for using the
 * ForSyDe-SystemC library.
 * It is generated automatically from the library source code and is updated
 * with the library itself.
 *
 * \subsection scope_purpose Scope and Purpose
 *
 * This document provides the designer with information about the constructs
 * provided by the library and how they can be used practically.
 * It does NOT describe the general modeling concepts and formalisms behind
 * ForSyDe.
 *
 * It is suggested to consult the ForSyDe webpage and Wiki page before starting
 * modeling with this library.
 * More information and tutorials are available there.
 *
 * \section using_doc Using the Documentation
 *
 * ForSyDe-SystemC library mainly includes constructs to build processes in
 * different Models of Computation (MoCs) and connect them using domain
 * interfaces.
 *
 * \subsection namespaces_mocs Namespaces and MoCs
 *
 * Everything provided by the ForSyDe-SystemC library is a member of the
 * ForSyDe namespace.
 * In addition, there is a separate sub-namespace dedicated to each MoC which
 * includes process constructors and other constructs related to that specific
 * MoC.
 * There are different MoCs suported in ForSyDe-SystemC:
 *
 *     - Synchronous MoC in ForSyDe::SY
 *     - Untimed MoC in ForSyDe::UT and its Synchronous Dataflow variant in ForSyDe::SDF
 *     - Two timed MoCs Distributed Discrete-Event in ForSyDe::DDE and Discrete-Time in ForSyDe::DT
 *     - Continuous-Time MoC in ForSyDe::CT

/*! \file forsyde.hpp
 * \brief Exports the library definitions for the ForSyDe-SystemC

 *  The user only includes this header file. Definitions in the other
 * files of the library are re-exported from here.
