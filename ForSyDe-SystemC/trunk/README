 ForSyDe's SystemC-embedded Domain Specific Language.
 ====================================================

DESCRIPTION

 The ForSyDe (Formal System Design) methodology has been developed
 with the objective to move design of heterogeneous embedded systems
 to a higher level of abstraction and to bridge the abstraction gap
 by transformational design refinement.
 
 This library provides the implementation of ForSyDe's modeling
 framework as a SystemC-embedded Domain Specific Language (DSL). 

 For more information, API documentation, and tutorials please visit the
