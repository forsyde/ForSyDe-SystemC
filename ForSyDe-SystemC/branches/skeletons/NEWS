* Noteworthy changes in release 0.4.0 (2013-11-17)

** General Improvements
  
  Replaced/renamed the DE MoC with a new DDE MoC
  
  Add new heterogeneous system model examples.
  
  Bug fixes and improvements in different MoCs and also introspection
  
  Add data-parallel process constructors with possible OpenMP-based simulation
  
  Add the strict version of the process constructors in the SY MoC
  
  Common base for signals and ports of different MoCs and unifies naming aliases
  
  More process constructors to enrich different MoCs

* Noteworthy changes in release 0.3.0 (2013-05-05)

** General Improvements

  Re-designed the library based on a common abstract semantics.
  
  Re-implemented the introspection facility. Now the models dump their
  structure as a well-defined XML format. There is also support for
  basic type-introspection.
  
  Added support for the new MoCs untimed (UT) and discrete-time (DT),
  and re-implemented the discrete-event (DE) MoC based on the common
  abstract semantics.
  
  Added new domain interfaces DE2CT, CT2DE, SY2DE, DE2SY, SDF2SY, SY2SDF.
  
  Several new examples for different MoCs.
  
  Added support for basic parallel and distributed simulation using MPI.
  
  Added support for data-parallel operations by adding new process
  constructors to the SY MoC.
