</p>

ForSyDe-SystemC uses the [SystemC](www.accellera.org/downloads/standards/systemc) class library to implement ForSyDe.

An intermediate representation of ForSyDe models based on XML and C++ files, called ForSyDe-XML, can be used for development of analysis and synthesis backends.
Currently, ForSyDe-SystemC can generate this intermediate representation by means of introspection.

## Getting the Tools 
The latest version of our supporting modeling libraries and development tools can be obtained from the [repository]({{ site.github.repository_url }}). 

### Getting the Latest Version 
If you would like to see how [ForSyDe](https://github.com/forsyde) looks today, you can check it out directly from our repositories.

### Downloading Packaged Releases 
It is also possible to to download ForSyDe tools as packaged releases, but you may not get the newly added functionalities.
